## The Notebook

As mentioned in the [preface](/readme.md), this is simply just some notes I make as I study Machine Learning. So I would like to give full disclosure that I am not an expert in this field--yet.

### Python vs R

The software I in this notebook will Python along with the Conda stack. Despite the course I am following contains both  R and Python Programming languages, I feel that I would have to choose where I am closely working since I am a software developer. Though I still find learning R interesting though I feel it would be best to leave it to non-developers or those who are intereseted judging by how high level the it is.

## The Author

I am a Software Developer who is currently interested in trying out Machine Learning. I have been programming for almost 6 years and I am having this curiousity to step into a new field.
