# Preparing the Tools

We will be preparing the tools needed.

### Anaconda

Perhaps the easiest way to install all of the tools needed such as pandas, jupyter notebook, and spyder. It's software conda allows you to manage dependencies and create virtual environments as well. Conda allows installation of packages that are not only python-based. You can even install R and RStudio!

Anaconda also comes built with a tool called **Anaconda Navigator**, a GUI based launcher for conda.
