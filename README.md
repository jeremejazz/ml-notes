# Machine Learning Notes

This is a notebook from what I've learn in Machine Learning. As of now I am currently following [Machine Learning AZ™: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science](https://www.udemy.com/machinelearning/). I might also pick some books when I am not watching the video course. In case you have any suggestions or concerns, feel free to open a ticket in the Repo Page of this notebook \([https://github.com/jeremejazz/ml-notes/issues](https://github.com/jeremejazz/ml-notes/issues "https://github.com/jeremejazz/ml-notes/issues")\)
