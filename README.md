# Machine Learning Notes
*update Oct 2017: As of this moment I am going to migrate from gitbook to jupyter notebook. I just found out that github renders ipynb files which is more appropriate in writing for data science*

This is a notebook from what I've learn in Machine Learning. As of now I am currently following [Machine Learning AZâ„¢: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science](https://www.udemy.com/machinelearning/). I might also pick some books when I am not watching the video course. In case you have any suggestions or concerns, feel free to open a ticket in the Repo Page of this notebook \([https://github.com/jeremejazz/ml-notes/issues](https://github.com/jeremejazz/ml-notes/issues "https://github.com/jeremejazz/ml-notes/issues")\)
